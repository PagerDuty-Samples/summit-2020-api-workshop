# PagerDuty Summit API Workshop

This workshop creates an App that integrates with Twitter and subscribes to the #PagerDutySummit hashtag for content. You will get the opportunity to make use of PagerDutyâ€™s Events API, REST API, and Webhooks as well as learn how they are different and when to use each one.

The workshop will be conducted using the Python programming language and is suitable for all skill levels, including beginners. Code samples and hints will be provided if you get stuck, and there will also be a live walkthrough if you prefer to just follow along.
